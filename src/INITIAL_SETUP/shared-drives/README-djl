Here's the "Squadron_Drive_Folders_Create script I used to create unit
drive file hierarchies. Things to know. First, the user/actor must be
an organizer on all the drives. Second, the drives must exist. Third,
you will need to supply a list of the drive names on the command line.
I had at one time used a conf file with the drive names, but we have
added squadrons, so I made it an argument so I could do one offs.

The "unitRoleAccts" script needs to be adjusted for your situation.



PS.

I forgot to mention the account create includes a randomly generated
password using a little generator I wrote a couple of decades ago, so
you'll need to come up with something for that.
