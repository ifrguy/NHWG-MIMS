# Runs through a list of groups I allow people to "unsubscribe"
# from but since groups are automatically update from eServices
# regularly and I don't keep track of unsubscribers in the database
# members can't really unsubscribe.
# As a workaround set memebers delivery status to "No email", this
# will stop the complaints and resolve itself when those members
# leave the organization.

# Reads the groups to be scanned from a CSV file, reads output CSV file
# and updates the group members delivery option to "No email"

# Default input CSV file to read the group email addresses from
# The column MUST be NAMED "group", each following row is the
# email address of the target group.
#
# Example CSV file:
# group
# group1@example.com
# group2@example.com
# group3@example.com
# ...

# Default csv input for groups to look at
INPUT_CSV_FILE="./groupsToScanForUnsubscribeEvents.csv"

# for unsubscribe events
LOOKBACK_PERIOD=7d  #7 days
