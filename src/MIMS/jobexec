# jobexec is designed to be run as a cron job, when awakened it
# scans the JOBS directory for .job files.  The jobs are executed in sort
# order, successfully completed job files are move to the completed
# directory.  Job files that begin with "HOLD-" | "hold-"  are skipped. Jobs
# that run with errors are moved from the queue to completed and errors
# are reported, this is to prevent unintended re-runs.
#
# History:
# 04Apr23 MEG Exit if no jobs found.
# 09Mar23 MEG jobexec now deletes job files that contain no gam actions.
# 02Jan22 MEG If job aborts continue, report and skip to next job.
# 10Oct20 MEG Moved reporting mailing list to conf file
# 28Apr18 MEG bash replaced with gam batch to execute jobs.
# 13Mar18 MEG Skip missing job or log files.
# 05Feb18 MEG print tail of log file as report.
# 02Sep17 MEG Jobs that have errors now sent to "completed" regardless.
# 07Jul17 MEG Created.
