    SweepExpired is intended as a maintenance function.  It's purpose is to
    scan the Member collection for old memberships that have expired, but not
    been removed or marked as EXMEMBER and mark them, records are purged
    from the Google collection depending on the state of the DELETE_PURGED
    configuration option. The default lookback period is 30 days beyond
    LOOKBACK + GRACE unless argv[2] contains an integer value.

    SweepExpired creates a job file to delete any accounts found in the Google
    collection as a precaution.  This may fail if the account has already
    been deleted, but it's a small price to pay for security.
