    NewMembers - Is the base class for all member creation subclasses.
    It is intended as an abstract class containing services needed by
    subclasses to create new Google accounts.  In most cases the new member
    creation subclass will only need to declare the query needed to find
    potential members in the Member collection, and the name of the
    mailing list/group if any used by those members.  Each new member
    has the wing calendars added to their personal calendar list.

    The run method does the work of generating the commands necessary to
    create the members Gmail account and add to the mailing list supplied.
    In rare cases with special requirements a subclass may need to
    override the run method.
